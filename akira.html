      <h2 >Plot</h2>
      <p>
        The year is 2019. Following a cataclysmic explosion that obliterated Tokyo and ignited World War III, a new city has risen from the ruins—<strong>Neo-Tokyo</strong>, a dystopian metropolis teeming with unrest. Corruption runs deep in the government, the streets are ruled by biker gangs, and society teeters on the edge of collapse. Amidst the turmoil, a young gang member named <strong>Tetsuo Shima</strong> encounters a mysterious child with psychic abilities during a high-speed chase, setting off a chain of events that will alter the fate of the city.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the accident, Tetsuo begins to manifest terrifying supernatural powers. What starts as a chance to stand tall after a life of feeling weak and overlooked quickly turns into a nightmare of escalating violence, paranoia, and madness. His abilities grow beyond his control, drawing the attention of the military, secretive government scientists, and a resistance group determined to uncover the truth behind a powerful, god-like figure known only as <strong>Akira</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the heart of this escalating chaos is <strong>Shotaro Kaneda</strong>, Tetsuo's childhood friend and the charismatic leader of their biker gang. Determined to save Tetsuo—or stop him—Kaneda dives deep into the conspiracy surrounding Akira, navigating brutal military crackdowns, political intrigue, and surreal confrontations with psychic children known as the Espers.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Tetsuo spirals into uncontrollable transformation and the government prepares to strike, Neo-Tokyo is pushed toward the brink of annihilation once more. The final confrontation unfolds in a decaying Olympic stadium—a symbol of hope now turned battlefield—where the true nature of Akira is revealed, and the lines between destruction and rebirth, chaos and transcendence, are violently blurred.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Akira</em> is more than just a tale of psychic powers and rebellion—it's a philosophical exploration of human evolution, technological ambition, and the fragile line that separates progress from ruin.
